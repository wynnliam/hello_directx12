# Hello DirectX 12

This is my repository for all my learnings for DirectX 12. I don't really have
a vision for this. I suppose I want to make a "basically functional rendering
system" in DirectX 12.

This project is based mostly around the following tutorials:
1. [DirectX Graphics Samples](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectX-Graphics-Samples)
2. [3DGEP's Learning DirectX 12](https://www.3dgep.com/learning-directx-12-1/)

# What's in this project?
All it does is renders a simple triangle on a cornflower blue screen. It's not
much but the amount of effort for this Herculean. That's because DX12 basically
leaves everything to you to set up.

# What do you want to add in the future?
Plase see `todo.txt` in the repository. This is a list of things I want to add.
As I work on things, this list is bound to grow. At some point I'd like to use
Github's Project board to keep track of all the cool features.
