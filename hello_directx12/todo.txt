Basically an on-going list of things I would like to do. Note
that these are not listed in any particular order.

In progress:
* Basic texture'd triangle

TODO:
* Specify an MVP matrix in shader
	* Implies depth testing
* Textured cube
* Load textures from file
* Correct shader/application input data
* Better synchronization mechanism
* Do learning about the sampler type that is used
* Replace upload heap used in vertex buffer creation
* Understand texture row/pitch
