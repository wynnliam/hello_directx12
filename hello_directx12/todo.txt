Basically an on-going list of things I would like to do. Note
that these are not listed in any particular order.

* Specify an MVP matrix in shader
	* Implies depth testing
* Vertex Index Buffer
* Textured cube
* Load textures from file
* Correct shader/application input data
* Better synchronization mechanism
* Replace upload heap used in vertex buffer creation
