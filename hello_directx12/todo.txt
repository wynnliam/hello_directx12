Basically an on-going list of things I would like to do. Note
that these are not listed in any particular order.

* Cube
	* Eventually make textured.
	* Specify an MVP matrix in shader
		* Implies depth testing
* Load textures from file
* Better synchronization mechanism
* Replace upload heap used in vertex buffer creation
