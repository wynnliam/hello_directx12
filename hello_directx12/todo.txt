Basically an on-going list of things I would like to do. Note
that these are not listed in any particular order.

* Refactor initialize_vertex_buffer
	* Include rename as well
* Cube
	* Eventually make textured.
* Specify an MVP matrix in shader
	* Implies depth testing
* Load textures from file
* Better synchronization mechanism
* Replace upload heap used in vertex buffer creation
